We'll need to:
    1. Open an article
    2. Find the first link in the article
    3. Follow the link
    4. Repeat this process until we reach the Philosophy article.

Use while loop until soup.p.a = <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophy>

Use list to build a list of all the places I've gone

I'll need to pause for a coupe seconds so wikipedia doesn't think I'm flooding their server (see robots.txt)


page = a random starting page
article_chain = []
while title of page isn't 'Philosophy' and we have not discovered a cycle:
    append page to article_chain
    download the page content
    find the first link in the content
    page = that link
    pause for a second
